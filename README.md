A Chrome extension to change the current date and time seen by websites. The
result is similar to changing the system time, and can be used to debug
frontend JavaScript applications.

## Usage
- Click the extension icon in the toolbar.
- Enter the date and time you want to set and confirm, e.g.:
  - "2023-04-27 12:40" (local time)
  - "2023-04-27" (midnight local time)
  - "2023-04-27T12:40Z" (UTC)
- When first activating the extension on a tab, click Reload when prompted.
- üéâ Any JavaScript `Date` object will now return the fake date/time you set!

To restore the system time, click the extension icon and press Reset.

By default, the clock will be paused when the fake time is turned on.
You can press the play (‚ñ∂) button to make the fake clock tick forward at a normal rate.
Press stop (‚èπ) to pause the clock .
