A Chrome extension to change the current JavaScript date and time seen by websites.
You can use it to debug time-dependent frontend applications without having to change the system time.

## Usage
- Switch to the tab where you want to change the time
- Click the extension icon in the toolbar.
- Enter the date and time you want to set and confirm, e.g.:
  - "2023-04-27 12:40" (local time)
  - "2023-04-27" (midnight local time)
  - "2023-04-27T12:40Z" (set local equivalent for given UTC time)
  - "2023-04-27T12:40+1130" (set local equivalent for time with +11:30 timezone offset)
  - "2023-03-25T12:40:00.120" (local time with milliseconds)
  - "1731493140025" (UNIX timestamp)
- When first activating the extension on a tab, click Reload when prompted.
- üéâ Any JavaScript `Date` object in the current tab now returns the fake date/time you set.

To restore the system time, click the extension icon and press Reset.

When the fake time is turned on, the clock is paused by default.
You can press the play (‚ñ∂) button to make the fake clock tick forward at a normal rate.
Press stop (‚èπ) to pause the clock.
